Hello there. My name is Tiago, and I am a student of Technology in Systems for the Internet at the Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná. I have also been a developer for 2.5 years, and in my spare time, I enjoy having fun with various interesting little projects, exploring a lot in the programming world.
